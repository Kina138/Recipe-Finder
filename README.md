# Recipe Finder: Input-Process-Output Model Analysis

The **Recipe Finder** application is designed to help users **discover, add, update, and delete** recipes. This system follows the **Input-Process-Output (IPO) model**, a structured approach used in software engineering to define how data flows through a system. By breaking down the application's logic into **input, process, and output**, we can understand how user interactions transform into useful recipe management features.

## **1️⃣ Input: User Data Entry & Interaction**

The first step in the IPO model is **input collection**. The Recipe Finder application allows users to provide input in multiple ways:

### **📥 User Inputs**
Users can interact with the system by entering data or selecting existing recipes. Inputs include:
- **Recipe Name** – A text input field where users provide the title of the recipe.
- **Ingredients** – A list of ingredients required to prepare the dish, entered as comma-separated values.
- **Instructions** – Step-by-step cooking instructions for preparing the dish.
- **User Actions** – Clicking buttons to add, edit, delete, or view recipes.

### **📌 Input Sources**
- **Form Submission**: Users enter details through an input form when adding a recipe.
- **Navigation Clicks**: Clicking on a recipe name navigates to its details page.
- **Edit Requests**: Clicking "Edit" opens a form pre-filled with the existing recipe data.
- **Delete Requests**: Clicking "Delete" removes a recipe from the database.

This structured input mechanism ensures that data is collected in a **user-friendly and efficient** manner.

## **2️⃣ Process: Data Handling & System Computation**

Once input is received, the system processes it using **backend logic** and **database operations**.

### **🛠 Backend Processing (Node.js & Express)**
1. **Data Validation** – Ensuring that user inputs (recipe name, ingredients, instructions) are correctly formatted before storing them.
2. **Routing & API Calls** – Handling different requests such as adding, retrieving, updating, and deleting recipes using RESTful API routes.
3. **Database Interaction** – The application communicates with **MongoDB Atlas** using **Mongoose**:
   - **Creating a Recipe** (`POST /api/recipes`) – Saves the new recipe in the database.
   - **Fetching Recipes** (`GET /api/recipes`) – Retrieves all stored recipes.
   - **Fetching a Single Recipe** (`GET /api/recipes/:id`) – Gets details of a specific recipe.
   - **Updating a Recipe** (`PUT /api/recipes/:id`) – Modifies existing recipe data.
   - **Deleting a Recipe** (`DELETE /api/recipes/:id`) – Removes a recipe from the database.

### **⚙ Frontend Processing (React.js)**
- The application dynamically updates the **UI** using React **state management** and **React Router** for navigation.
- **Axios** is used for making API requests to fetch, create, update, and delete recipes.
- When a user navigates between pages, the UI remains interactive and responsive, improving user experience.

This process ensures that all **input data is securely handled, stored, and updated** in the system.

## **3️⃣ Output: Displaying Processed Data to Users**

After processing, the system provides **meaningful output** to users in different ways.

### **🖥️ UI Output (Frontend)**
- **Recipe List Page**: Displays all stored recipes in an organized format.
- **Recipe Details Page**: Shows full details of a selected recipe, including ingredients and instructions.
- **Form Confirmation Messages**: Feedback is given to users upon successfully adding, editing, or deleting a recipe.
- **Dynamic Updates**: The React frontend updates automatically when a recipe is added, modified, or removed.

### **📡 API Responses (Backend)**
Each request made to the backend returns a **structured response**:
1. **Success Response** – When a recipe is successfully created, updated, or deleted.
2. **Error Handling** – If an operation fails (e.g., missing fields, invalid request), a proper error message is returned.
